# Apps
Program isolation solution from system and package manager (like appImages).  
Because you don't need GTK libraries on the server, right?

### Wait a sec
These apps are not portable between distro versions - if you want app for debian buster, you must build it on debian buster.  
How? See app's readme.

### Updates?
No. If you think about it, you need a full version of app, not a temporary one.
