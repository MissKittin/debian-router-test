resolvconf-updater queue

*.top.conf will be added at the top of resolv.conf, *.bottom.conf at the bottom.
If there are no *.top.conf files, addresses provided by the dhcp client will be used.
Hint: *.top.conf files will be added in reverse order.

WARNING: libc limitation of nameservers (MAXNS) is 3 by default.
However dnsmasq can use all nameservers (except loopback).
